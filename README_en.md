# Ankara Coffee Sales Analysis  

## Why I Chose This Project  
Coffee is my passion. I love visiting coffee shops, trying different types and drinks, exploring flavor combinations, and immersing myself in the atmosphere of these places.  

But at some point, I asked myself: how do coffee shops operate from a business perspective? What drinks become bestsellers? At what times is customer flow the highest? What, besides coffee, brings in the most profit? The answers to these questions became the foundation of my project.  

## 🔍 Project Objective  

My main goal is to analyze coffee shop sales in my city and identify key factors that influence business success.

#### In this project, I aim to:

- Understand the financial side of the business. How much does a coffee shop earn on average? Find out the total number of sales and total revenue across cafes.
- Identify the top 5 most popular products in each coffee shop.
- Understand the sales share of each product category (Coffee is expected to be the top one, but what's next?)
- Determine peak visiting hours. When are coffee shops at their busiest — morning before work, lunch breaks, or evening?

#### I also want to find out:

- The impact of additional products. Which snacks or desserts bring in the most revenue? Should coffee shops focus more on pastries or, for example, alternative drinks?
- Average receipt per product category
- Revenue by day of the week
- Revenue based on the location of the coffee shop
- Which coffee types are ordered most frequently? Are there any seasonal favorites?

This project is more than just research. It’s an opportunity to dive deeper into the world of the coffee industry, understand its patterns, and possibly help coffee shop owners optimize their operations.

#### ☕ Coffee is art, business, and pleasure all at once. And I want to understand how these elements interact.
